## Setup api key

The api we're using requires an api key.  
Sign up for an api key on https://countrylayer.com/

When you have your api key, create an `.env.local` file with the following content:

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Run the app

Run `yarn` to install dependencies

Run `yarn start` to start the application

Run `yarn test` to run the tests
